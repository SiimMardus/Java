This program reads pseudocode lines from a given text file and executes it

Example input file "example.txt":

    print 5
    x = 4
    y =35 +  78- x
    print x+    78 -23
    # This is a comment
    print y
    y = y + 1 # Changing the variable
    print y
    

Executing the program with the example file should have the following result:

    5
    59
    109
    110
